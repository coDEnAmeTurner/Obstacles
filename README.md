This is my first ever game project made in Unity. It is an unfinished one, made with an aim to test out different Unity functionalities.

It is a follow-along type of project made in the process of studying the first chapter of Complete C# 3D Game Development Course (by GameDev.tv). I believe the project is a good hands-on attempt into the world of game developing with the help of Unity.
